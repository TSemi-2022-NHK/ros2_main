CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:11 (find_package):
  By not providing "Find../socketcan_interface_msg.cmake" in
  CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has asked CMake to find a package
  configuration file provided by "../socketcan_interface_msg", but CMake did
  not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "../socketcan_interface_msg" with any of the following names:

    ../socketcan_interface_msgConfig.cmake
    ../socketcan_interface_msg-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "../socketcan_interface_msg" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "../socketcan_interface_msg_DIR" to a directory
  containing one of the above files.  If "../socketcan_interface_msg"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
